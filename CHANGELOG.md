# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Show DeepSeek models in the Copilot Chat model picker as soon as the extension is active, even before an API key is configured.
- Add model picker warning state for missing API keys, with guidance to run `DeepSeek: Set API Key`.
- Add a first-run walkthrough with inline actions for getting an API key, setting an API key, and opening VS Code's Language Models manager.
- Move Thinking Effort from extension settings into Copilot Chat's native model picker configuration, with `None`, `High`, and `Max` options. `High` remains the default to match DeepSeek's default behavior.
- Remove the obsolete `deepseek-copilot.thinking` and `deepseek-copilot.thinkingEffort` settings.
- Refresh model metadata after setting or clearing the API key, and refresh provider state during extension deactivation so DeepSeek models are removed when the extension unloads.
- Fix vision proxy lookup so it only starts when actual `image/*` attachments are present, avoiding unnecessary model selection for text-only requests.
- Simplify DeepSeek model descriptions and update README setup/configuration guidance.

## 0.1.1

- Rename display name to `DeepSeek V4 for Copilot Chat` to avoid Marketplace name collision
